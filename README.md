# sequence-alignment
Implementation of the Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch algortihms for local and global genetic sequence alignment.

Switching between the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the Smith-Waterman algorithm is done through the "local"-flag in the "align"-function.
Scores for matches, mismatches and gaps can be specified by the user.

This programming task was given as a biweekly assignment in the class "Computational Biology" by Tanja Stadler, Carsten Magnus and Tim Vaughan at ETH Zurich.
The structure of the code was given, the implementation of the algortihms is my own.
